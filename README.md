# MLX90392-Library
Arduino library for Melexis' MLX90392 3D Magnetometers.

This library has been written with the assistance of GitHub Copilot.

This library has not been fully tested (yet). This library includes examples.

This library is developed and tested on the Adafruit RP2040 Feather board, but can probably be reused for other Arduino boards with minimal changes.

This library is set to only use Wire. Not Wire1, Wire2, etc. You can easily change this by adding '1', '2', etc to all instances of the word "Wire".
